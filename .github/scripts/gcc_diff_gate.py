"""Diff-scoped gcc warning gate (PROPOSAL — branch ci/diff-scoped-warning-gate).

Gate not-yet-promoted gcc warning classes on the PR's changed lines *only*, without
promoting them tree-wide. The OneWifi tree still carries backlogs for these classes
(e.g. -Wvla: 18 sites, -Wreturn-type: 11), so a whole-file/tree -Werror would red every
PR. Instead lets recompile each changed .c/.cpp from compile_commands.json with the candidate
warnings enabled (non-fatal: the DB's own -Werror=<class> promotions are stripped and -Os is
applied when OPT is set — see recompile_cmd), then keep only findings whose line the PR changed.
A PR can then fail on a class that fires on a line it changed. NB this is
line-scoped, not base-compared: a warning already present on a line the PR
edits for an unrelated reason also counts (accepted trade-off, not literally
"newly introduced").
The silent baseline (and the build-summary that relies on it) remains unaffected.

This is the gcc analogue of the clang-tidy changed-files gate already in makefile.yml.
Because each file is recompiled on its own, every warning in that compile belongs to that
file, so filtering on the line number alone is sufficient (same reasoning as clang-tidy).
No need to filter on file:line pairs as analyzing full build.log would require

Env:
  BASE               PR base sha (already fetched by the caller)
  GATE_WARNINGS      space-separated -W flags that FAIL the job when introduced on a changed line
  ADVISORY_WARNINGS  space-separated -W flags that are only reported
  ENFORCE            'false' -> advisory (render ❌ but exit 0). default enforce
  OPT                optimization level for the recompile only (e.g. '-Os' to match
                     production and wake middle-end warnings). Empty -> keep the DB's -O.
  ANALYZER           truthy ('1'/'true'/...) -> also run a time-boxed gcc -fanalyzer pass
                     per changed file (informational: summary-only, never gates/inlines).
  ANALYZER_TIMEOUT   per-file -fanalyzer wall-clock cap in seconds (default 90).
  REPO_DIR           dir the changed files + git history live in (default '.'; the HAL sets
                     this to '../rdk-wifi-hal' since its DB lives in the cloned OneWifi cwd)
  INLINE_JSON        optional path; when set, also write a review_poster.py candidate
                     envelope (source 'gcc-gate') of the ADVISORY findings so they can be
                     posted as inline PR review comments (Commit 5). GATED findings are
                     summary-only, never inline. Empty/unset -> no file.
Exit: 1 iff a GATE class fired on a changed line (and ENFORCE); else 0. Always writes a
markdown summary to stdout. Identical file ships in OneWifi and the HAL — the INLINE_JSON
support must be re-ported verbatim when this file is synced to the HAL.

    HEAD^2 the PR head. The frozen event-payload BASE

    case). Probe (b) makes the merge-ref parent-order assumption self-verifying: if
    HEAD is not a merge commit, or the base was rewritten so BASE no longer leads
    into HEAD^1, fall back to BASE (today's exact two-dot behavior). Never raises;
    worst case it returns BASE. The HAL leg runs this same file against
